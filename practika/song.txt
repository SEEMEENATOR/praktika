Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh
Over the hills we go
Laughing all the way.
The bells on bobtail ring
They make spirits bright
What fun it is to ride
And sing a sleighing song tonight.

Припев:
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
What fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh, hey

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh.

A day or two ago
I thought I’d take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side.

The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
We got into a drifted bank
And we will got upsot.

Припев:
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh, hey

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh.

Now the ground is white
To go while we are young
Take the girls tonight
And sing this sleighing song.

Just get a bobtailed bay
Two-forty is his speed
Then hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! You’ll take the lead, oh!
